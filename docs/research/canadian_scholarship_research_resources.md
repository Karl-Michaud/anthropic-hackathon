## 3. PUBLIC SCHOLARSHIP WINNER STORIES & APPLICATION EXAMPLES

### **WINNING ESSAY EXAMPLE 1: Loran-Style Character Essay**

**Prompt**: Describe a defining moment that revealed your character and values.

**Excerpt from Composite Winner Profile**:

"Every Saturday for three years, I've watched newcomers to Canada struggle with the same English phrases my mother still hesitates over. When Mrs. Chen finally read a grocery store sign without asking for help, I understood: language is freedom.

This realization—that small, sustained acts of service create tangible dignity—has shaped every choice since. When the community center's ESL program failed (20% retention rate), I didn't just notice. I acted.

The existing curriculum targeted extremes: materials for children or university students, nothing for working adults learning functional English. So I designed curriculum for them—grocery vocabulary, job interviews, parent-teacher conferences. Not because it looked good on applications. Because watching my parents—educated professionals in the Philippines—navigate Canadian systems without language confidence taught me: dignity isn't granted, it's enabled.

Sixty students later, retention went from 20% to 80%. But the metrics don't capture what matters. What matters is that Mrs. Chen now navigates stores independently. That Mr. Patel called to say he got a job after we practiced interview phrases. That parents attend school meetings without translators.

This work has taught me about character under pressure. When balancing 15 hours of weekly work, school, and ESL sessions felt impossible, I learned: commitment means showing up when it's hard. When students progressed slowly, I learned: patience and consistency matter more than quick results. When I saw the broader pattern—how language barriers prevent integration—I learned: true leadership means addressing root problems, not symptoms.

I choose this work not for recognition but because authentic values demand action. My character isn't about grand gestures. It's about showing up every Saturday. It's about designing better solutions when existing ones fail. It's about believing that everyone deserves the dignity my parents were denied—and doing something about it."

**Why It Works**:
- Opens with specific, memorable moment (Mrs. Chen)
- Connects personal experience to values (parents' struggle → commitment to helping others)
- Demonstrates sustained commitment (3 years, every Saturday)
- Shows initiative and problem-solving (identified failing program, designed solution)
- Includes measurable impact (20% → 80% retention) without leading with metrics
- Reveals character through choices (worked when difficult, persisted when progress was slow)
- Clear values-driven narrative (dignity, service, commitment)
- Authentic voice (not overly formal or performative)

### **WINNING ESSAY EXAMPLE 2: TD-Style Community Problem-Solving Essay**

**Prompt**: Describe your community leadership experience. How has your involvement made your community more inclusive and sustainable?

**Excerpt from Composite Winner Profile**:

"The community center's ESL program was dying. Month over month, fewer newcomers returned. I watched from my volunteer tutoring sessions as attendance dropped from 30 students in September to 8 by January.

I didn't blame the students. I blamed the program.

The problem was obvious once I looked: we were using elementary school worksheets for adults who'd been engineers and teachers in their home countries. Imagine the indignity—a physician learning colors and shapes while needing English for medical licensing exams.

I approached the program coordinator with a solution: let me redesign the curriculum for functional adult needs. Grocery shopping vocabulary. Job interview practice. Understanding legal documents. School communication for parents. 

She was skeptical. I was 16. But I showed her my own curriculum draft, explained how watching my parents navigate Canadian systems taught me what adults actually need, and promised measurable results.

We piloted with one class in March. By April, word spread. By September, we had 60 students enrolled—the highest in the program's history. Retention hit 80%.

But here's what matters more than metrics: Mrs. Chen shops independently now. Mr. Patel got a job at a manufacturing company. Parents attend school meetings without translators. These aren't just numbers. These are people integrating into Canadian society with dignity.

I learned that making communities inclusive isn't about generic "helping." It's about identifying specific barriers and designing targeted solutions. Language barriers don't just prevent communication—they prevent economic participation, civic engagement, and social integration.

My work has made our community more inclusive by giving newcomers the tools to participate fully in Canadian society. More sustainable by building a program model that works—one being adopted by two other community centers in our region.

This experience taught me that community leadership means:
1. Identifying problems others overlook (everyone saw low attendance; I saw why)
2. Designing solutions, not just participating (created new curriculum vs. volunteering with existing one)
3. Measuring impact (retention rate, student outcomes)
4. Thinking systemically (how does language access affect broader integration?)

Looking forward, I see this as a blueprint. Communities face complex problems—housing, employment, integration. Leadership means approaching them as I approached ESL: identify the specific barrier, design a targeted solution, measure impact, scale what works.

Our community is more inclusive because 60+ newcomers can now navigate Canadian systems with dignity. It's more sustainable because we've proven a model that works and spreads. That's what community leadership looks like—not just helping people, but changing systems."

**Why It Works**:
- Opens with specific problem (ESL program failing)
- Shows problem-solving approach (identified root cause, designed solution)
- Demonstrates initiative (approached coordinator with proposal)
- Includes specific outcomes (attendance numbers, retention rate increase)
- Connects individual stories to broader impact (Mrs. Chen, Mr. Patel examples)
- Directly addresses TD's language ("more inclusive and sustainable")
- Shows systems thinking (understands how language affects broader integration)
- Demonstrates scalability (model adopted by other centers)
- Connects to larger societal issues (integration, civic participation)

### **WINNING ESSAY EXAMPLE 3: Terry Fox Adversity + Service Essay**

**Prompt**: Describe obstacles you've overcome and how they've shaped your humanitarian commitment.

**Excerpt from Composite Winner Profile**:

"At 15, I became my mother's translator at every medical appointment, job interview, and parent-teacher conference. Watching my parents—educated professionals in the Philippines—struggle to navigate Canadian systems taught me something profound: courage isn't the absence of obstacles. It's showing up despite them.

My family immigrated when I was 12. My parents left established careers to give my siblings and me opportunities. But the cost was steep. My mother, a teacher with 20 years of experience, worked cleaning offices. My father, an accountant, drove for Uber. Both spoke limited English. Both needed me to interpret the smallest interactions—ordering at restaurants, understanding bills, reading school notices.

I learned quickly: if I wanted to help my family, I needed to work. At 14, I started tutoring younger students. By 15, I was working 15 hours weekly while taking advanced courses. Sleep became scarce. Free time disappeared. Social life was a luxury I couldn't afford.

But here's what those challenges taught me about character:

**Determination**: When juggling work, school, family responsibilities, and volunteer commitments felt impossible, I learned to show up anyway. Determination isn't about never struggling—it's about persisting when you are.

**Compassion**: Watching my parents face discrimination and navigate systems designed without them in mind taught me empathy. I understood why Mrs. Chen, an ESL student I tutored, cried when she read her first English book independently. Because I watched my mother cry when she couldn't help my sister with homework. Language barriers don't just prevent communication—they steal dignity.

**Fortitude**: There were weeks I wanted to quit everything. When my father's car broke down and we couldn't afford repairs, when report cards came and my grades had slipped, when I was exhausted from translating at parent-teacher conferences then staying up to finish homework. But I kept showing up—to work, to school, to my ESL tutoring sessions.

These experiences didn't just reveal character. They created it.

My humanitarian service stems directly from these challenges. I volunteer 300+ hours teaching ESL because I've watched language barriers destroy confidence. I redesigned our community center's curriculum because I knew from experience what adults actually need to learn. I show up every Saturday not despite my busy schedule but because my schedule taught me: if you have capacity to help, you have responsibility to do it.

Terry Fox ran across Canada while fighting cancer. He could have focused on his own survival. Instead, he chose to serve others. I understand that choice now. Not because my challenges compare to his—they don't. But because I've learned: adversity either embitters you or enlightens you. It teaches selfishness or service.

I choose service.

My parents sacrificed their careers for my opportunities. The least I can do is use those opportunities to help others facing similar challenges. Every ESL student I tutor is someone's parent, someone's spouse, someone trying to build a life in a new country. Just like mine were.

That's what courage means to me. Not the absence of obstacles, but the choice to help others overcome theirs. Even when—especially when—you're still overcoming your own."

**Why It Works**:
- Opens with vivid specific context (becoming family translator at 15)
- Demonstrates real adversity (financial challenges, family responsibilities, balancing work/school)
- Shows courage through continued service despite personal obstacles
- Explicitly connects Terry Fox's values to own experience
- Demonstrates character revealed through challenges (determination, compassion, fortitude)
- Balances vulnerability (authentic struggles) with agency (continued action despite difficulty)
- Clear connection between adversity and humanitarian commitment
- Authentic voice avoiding victimhood or excessive triumph narrative

### **WINNING ESSAY EXAMPLE 4: Schulich Entrepreneurial Mindset Essay**

**Prompt**: Describe how you demonstrate an entrepreneurial mindset (leadership, charisma, creativity). (250 words)

**Winner Example**:

"Entrepreneurial thinking isn't about starting companies—it's about seeing problems and building solutions.

When our robotics team chose to design a water filtration system for developing communities, I saw everyone focused on technical specs. I focused on a different question: why does clean water cost so much?

The answer? Existing solutions prioritize perfection over affordability. Industrial filters remove 99.99% of contaminants. But communities without access to clean water would benefit from 95% filtration if it cost 1/10th the price.

So I reframed our project: design for "good enough at affordable" rather than "perfect at any cost."

This required entrepreneurial thinking at every stage:

**Problem identification**: Researched actual water quality issues in target communities (not assumptions)
**Resourcefulness**: Used locally-available materials (PVC pipes, sand, gravel) instead of imported tech
**Testing and iteration**: Built 14 prototypes, testing each against cost and effectiveness metrics
**Scalability thinking**: Designed for local manufacturing and maintenance, not dependence on external supply chains

The result? A working prototype that removes 92% of common contaminants at approximately $30 per unit—compared to $300+ for commercial alternatives.

But entrepreneurial mindset extends beyond projects. It's how I approach challenges:
- See gaps? Design solutions (created new ESL curriculum when existing one failed)
- Lack resources? Improvise (taught myself CAD through YouTube when school didn't offer it)
- Hit obstacles? Iterate (14 prototype failures taught more than initial success would have)

Entrepreneurship isn't about business plans. It's about asking: what problem exists, what solution could work, and what's preventing anyone from building it?

Then building it anyway."

**Why It Works**:
- Opens with strong definition of entrepreneurial thinking
- Demonstrates problem-reframing (affordable vs. perfect)
- Shows technical competency (14 prototypes, testing methodology)
- Includes specific metrics (92% filtration, $30 vs. $300 cost)
- Demonstrates resourcefulness and creativity
- Connects to broader patterns of entrepreneurial behavior
- Focuses on innovation and applied problem-solving (not activism or academic theory)
- Shows leadership through creation, not just participation

**Video Question 1** (60-90 seconds): "What makes you curious?"

**Strong Response Framework**:
- Open with specific example of curiosity in action
- Show intellectual curiosity beyond just grades
- Demonstrate how curiosity drives learning
- Connect to sustained interests/pursuits

**Example**: "I'm curious about systems. Not just how they work, but why they fail. That's what led me to redesign our ESL program—I was curious why retention dropped from 30 to 8 students. Every system that fails reveals a design flaw. I'm curious about finding those flaws and fixing them."

---

**Video Question 2** (60-90 seconds): "Describe a time you stood up for something you believed in"

**Strong Response Framework**:
- Specific situation with stakes
- What you believed/valued
- Risk you took
- Outcome and learning

**Example**: "When our school wanted to cut the ESL program due to low attendance, I stood before the school board with data: the program wasn't failing—its design was. I presented my redesigned curriculum and 15 students willing to try it. The board gave me one semester to prove it could work. That's when I learned: advocacy requires evidence, courage requires action."

---

#### **SCHULICH LEADER PROMPTS (2024-2025)**

**Top 3 Achievements** (50 words each maximum):
